# Model Card

For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

## Model Details
    Algorith: Random Forest Classifier 
    Data: Census Bureau Datasets

## Intended Use
    ML DevOps Deployment with Fastly. 
    The ML Model is intended to make predictions on salary label. 

## Training Data
    UCI Census Income

## Evaluation Data
    20% of data used for testing the ML Model.

## Metrics
_Please include the metrics used and your model's performance on those metrics._
    
    Model Trained on F1, Precision, and Recall.

    Model Performance:
    Precision: 0.7741 | Recall: 0.6327 | F1: 0.6963


## Ethical Considerations

    Ethical analysis does not always lead to precise solutions, but the process
    of ethical consideration is necesssary to inform data practices, with that said 
    data bias may occur at any stage during collection as well as preprocessing, to the best
    of our knowledge all data contained within is accurate and free of all intended bias at time of
    collection and processing.
        

## Caveats and Recommendations
    
    In this context, the following ML Model, workflow, and data has been designed for training purposes only.
